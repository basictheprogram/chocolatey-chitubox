    # Versatile editing tools
    Being easy doesn't mean lack of functionality. CHITUBOX Free gives you the tools you
    would need for editing, including rotation, scaling, mirroring, repairing,
    hollowing, cloning, hole digging, .... to help you generate perfect results.
    And they re easy to understand, convenient to operate and you can view your edits
    all at once.

    # Painless multi-model processing
    Arranging and organizing multiple models can be tedious at the best of times. But
    with CHITUBOX Free, everything is arranged in a neat way with two clicks.

    And NOTE! Processing multiple models in CHITUBOX Free is NOT slow. When importing,
    generating supports for and slicing them, these are all done very quickly, even
    when the models are large.

    # Straightforward support adding
    Adding support structures for your models can be as quickly as one click thanks to
    the program's auto mated identification and analysis of the model.

    You can also add, edit and move supports on your own. The functionalities to
    fine-tune support settings enable you to cali brate your support shapes, thickness,
    and density.

    # Fast and easy model slicing
    Slicing is easy on CHITUBOX Free not only because of its simple UI, but also the
    fast speed it processes the slicing of your model. You don't have to wait for
    long -- only a few seconds and you'll see the result.

    And with the preview feature, you can check your sliced model layer by layer and
    know how the printer would construct it when printing.
